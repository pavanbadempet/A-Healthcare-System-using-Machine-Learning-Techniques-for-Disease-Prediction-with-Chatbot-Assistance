## 2. "Free Money" Programs (Wait until you launch)
*Don't activate these until you are ready to scale, as the clock starts ticking once you apply.*

### 🇮🇳 Startup India (DPIIT Recognition)
*   **Benefit**: 3-Year Tax Holiday, Self-Certification.
*   **Credits**: Access to AWS/Azure credits specifically for Indian Startups.
*   **Cost**: ₹0 (Government Scheme).

### 🥇 Microsoft Founders Hub
*   **Reward**: $2,500 OpenAI Credits + Azure.
*   **Timing**: Apply only when you have 100+ users to maximize the 1-year duration.

## 3. Deployment Action Plan (India Optimized)

### Step A: Payment Gateway (Future)
*   **Use Razorpay**: The standard for Indian Startups.
*   **Why**: No setup fee, no annual maintenance fee (Standard Plan). You only pay ~2% per transaction.
*   **Action**: Create a "Test Mode" account for now (Free).

### Step B: Privacy (DPDP Act 2023)
*   India's *Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023* is strict.
*   **Advantage**: Our Architecture (Zero-Retention optional) is compliant by design.
*   **Action**: Ensure your Privacy Policy explicitly mentions a "Grievance Officer" (Required by Indian Law).

**Verdict**: The current setup (Render + Streamlit) is **safe**. It uses no credits and has no expiry. You can develop in peace.
